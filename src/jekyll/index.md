### Overview

This site is for user documentation for running Apache Spark with a native Kubernetes scheduling backend. This repository [apache-spark-on-k8s/spark](https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark), contains a fork of Apache Spark that enables running Spark jobs natively on a Kubernetes cluster.

### What is this?

This is a collaboratively maintained project working on [SPARK-18278](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18278). The goal is to bring native support for Spark to use Kubernetes as a cluster manager, in a fully supported way on par with the Spark Standalone, Mesos, and Apache YARN cluster managers.
